# Counter App

This is a simple counter app that demonstrates how to use Flet to create a UI.

## How to use

1. Install Flet:

```
pip install flet
```

2. Create a new Python file called `counter.py`:

```python
import flet as ft
from time import sleep

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.title = 'Counter App'
    
    text = ft.Text()
    page.add(text)

    for i in range (1, 12):
        text.value = 'Count ' + str(i)
        page.update()
        sleep(1) # This will sleep the program for a second
        
ft.app(target = main)
```

3. Run the app:

```
python counter.py
```

## Code explanation

The code for this app is very simple. Let's go through it step by step.

First, we import the necessary libraries:

```python
import flet as ft
from time import sleep
```

Next, we define the `main` function. This function will be called when the app is launched.

```python
def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.title = 'Counter App'
    
    text = ft.Text()
    page.add(text)

    for i in range (1, 12):
        text.value = 'Count ' + str(i)
        page.update()
        sleep(1) # This will sleep the program for a second
        
ft.app(target = main)
```

The first line of the `main` function sets the title of the app.

The second line creates a new `ft.Text` object. This object will be used to display the count.

The third line adds the `ft.Text` object to the page.

The fourth line starts a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to 11.

The fifth line sets the value of the `ft.Text` object to the current count.

The sixth line updates the page. This will cause the `ft.Text` object to be displayed with the new count.

The seventh line sleeps the program for one second. This will give the user time to see the new count.

The eighth line
